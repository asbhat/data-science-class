        "  u'request_text': u\"edit [Pizza Received] Thank you SaySheSaid2! \\n\\n\\nHi. 35/f, love long walks on the beach, wishes for world peace, etc.    \\n\\nI'm about another month of being poor away from my goal weight but food would be awesome too. Not sure how this works. Just looking for a small pizza (I think that would probably get me a couple of meals) and maybe a soda? My concern though is that I don't have enough cash to tip the driver for delivery and I think carry out has ended. Do these deals work somehow with tip included? If not, I think I would rather pass than not tip.    \\n\\nI get paid Friday so hoping to pay it forward then.\",\n",
